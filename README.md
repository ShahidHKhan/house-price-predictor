# 🏠 House Price Predictor
A Python project demonstrating linear regression for predicting housing prices based on house size using real data from Brooklyn’s DUMBO neighborhood.

## 📊 Overview
This project applies **linear regression** — a core concept in both statistics and machine learning — to estimate home prices based on square footage.

### Features
- Data preprocessing and visualization with **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**
- Predictive modeling using **Scikit-learn**
- Train/test data split for validation
- Visualization of both actual vs. predicted prices

## 🧩 Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 🚀 Getting Started
